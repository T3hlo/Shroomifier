# Shroomifier üçÑüí®

*A Humidifier for the Budding Mushroom Enthusiast*

So, you've recently found yourself mesmerized by the world of gourmet mushrooms‚Äîwelcome to the club! If you're anything like me, you started innocently enough, perhaps dreaming of a shiitake or lion's mane pasta, but soon found yourself surrounded by substrate, spores, and... a tent?

Enter **Shroomifier**, a Raspberry Pi Pico-powered humidifier system designed to keep your mushroom growing tent in tip-top shape. Whether you're nurturing delicate enoki or regal king oysters, this gadget ensures your fungi friends stay cozy with perfect humidity levels.

## Features üöÄ

- **Precise Humidity Control**: Powered by the SHT31 sensor, it monitors and maintains optimal humidity levels for mushroom growth.

- **Compact and Modular Design**: Built for the Raspberry Pi Pico, making it affordable and adaptable.

- **Customizable Settings**: Fine-tune your humidity thresholds with ease using the `config.json` file.

- **Real-time Display**: Includes TM1637 display support for showing live data like humidity and temperature.

- **Open-Source Goodness**: Fully hackable! Add features, tweak settings, or just marvel at the code.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Pico**
- **SHT31 Humidity and Temperature Sensor**
- **TM1637 4-Digit Display Module**
- A power supply, cables, and a mushroom tent full of potential.

### Software Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   bash
   
   
   Copy code
   git clone <repository-url>  
   ```

2. Flash your Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython (if not already done).

3. Copy the following files to your Pico:

   - `main.py`
   - `sht31.py`
   - `tm1637.py`
   - `config.json`

4. Adjust the `config.json` file to your preferred humidity and temperature settings:

   ```json
   jsonCopy code{  
       "humidity_target": 85,  
       "humidity_tolerance": 5  
   }  
   ```

5. Power up your Pico, place it in your mushroom tent, and watch the magic happen!

### Pin Connections

| Raspberry Pi Pico Pin | Module | Description |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| GPIO X                | SHT31  | Data line   |
| GPIO Y                | TM1637 | Clock       |
| GPIO Z                | TM1637 | Data        |

> Replace X, Y, and Z with the actual GPIO pins you're using.
